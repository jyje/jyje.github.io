# CAPA: Certified Argo Project Associate (2024)

* UNORDERED TOC
{:toc .large-only}

## 1. About the Certification

The Certified Argo Project Associate (CAPA) certification is a newly established credential in 2024 that validates expertise in the Argo Project ecosystem. The certification covers all four Argo projects that transform Kubernetes clusters into powerful DevOps platforms:

- **Argo Workflows**: Engine for workflow orchestration and generic pipelines including ML and CI/CD pipelines
- **Argo CD**: Declarative continuous deployment tool
- **Argo Rollouts**: Advanced deployment update strategies manager
- **Argo Events**: Event-driven kubernetes automation tool

The exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions to be completed within 90 minutes. A passing score of 75% is required, and the certification is valid for 2 years. The exam is proctored and conducted through the PSI Secure Browser environment.

## 2. My Experience

My CAPA certification 2024. Issued on September 14, 2024. Expires on September 15, 2026. You can verify my certification [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/ee42c2c7-2ac3-411f-8713-cc26cbec8022).

I pursued this certification after using Argo projects extensively in my professional work for two years. My experience included:

- Using Argo Workflows for data pipelines and CI/CD pipelines
- Implementing Argo CD for web application and Kubernetes resource deployments
- Managing deployment strategies with Argo Rollouts
- Building custom CI/CD event sourcing with Argo Events

The certification process helped me:
- Systematically organize my practical knowledge
- Discover hidden features I hadn't used before
- Better understand the official documentation
- Identify areas for improvement in our current implementations

For exam preparation, I focused on:
1. Thoroughly studying the official documentation for all four Argo projects
2. Implementing and testing various features in local Kubernetes environments
3. Practicing with different Kubernetes simulators (docker-desktop, kind, microk8s, orbstack)

The exam difficulty level is comparable to CKAD, making it accessible for those with hands-on experience while still requiring comprehensive knowledge of the tools.

## 3. Summary

The CAPA certification effectively validates practical knowledge of the Argo ecosystem. While the exam is multiple-choice, it requires deep understanding of how Argo components work together in real-world scenarios.

Key tips for those preparing for the certification:
- Take advantage of the official course if possible
- Practice with all four Argo projects, especially less commonly used features
- Pay attention to GUI-related questions, which appear frequently
- Study enterprise features even if you haven't used them in production

Looking ahead, I'm interested in pursuing any advanced-level Argo certifications that may be introduced in the future. The hands-on experience gained through this certification process has already helped improve our team's use of Argo projects.

I hope this post helps those considering the CAPA certification. The Argo Project is becoming increasingly important in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and this certification is a valuable way to validate your expertise in these tools.
