# CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator (2024)

## About the Certification

The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. As one of the highest velocity open source projects, Kubernetes use is exploding. The CKA program allows individuals to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment.

The CKA exam is a hands-on, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple issues from a command line running Kubernetes. The exam is focused on the skills required to be a Kubernetes Administrator in industry read-to-work environments.

<!-- Overview -->
I took the CKA exam on March 15, 2024, and passed it successfully. The exam was challenging, but I was able to pass it on my first attempt. I prepared for the exam by studying the official Kubernetes documentation, taking online courses, and practicing with Kubernetes clusters.

<!-- Udemy and KodeKloud -->
I took the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) course on Udemy, which helped me understand the core concepts of Kubernetes. I also used the [KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/udemy-labs-certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) platform to practice with Kubernetes clusters and complete hands-on labs. This is my course completion certificate from KodeKloud: [Udemy Labs - Certified Kubernetes Administrator with Practice Tests](https://kodekloud.com/certificate-verification/2D0D53315009-2D0D590835C9-2D0D4CFE3F61).
