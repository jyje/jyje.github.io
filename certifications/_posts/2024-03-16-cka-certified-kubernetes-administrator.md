# CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator (2024)

* UNORDERED TOC
{:toc}

## 1. About the Certification

The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in collaboration with The Linux Foundation to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. As one of the highest velocity open-source projects, Kubernetes use is exploding. The CKA program allows individuals to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment.

The CKA exam is a hands-on, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple issues from a command line running Kubernetes. The exam focuses on the skills required to be a Kubernetes Administrator in industry-ready work environments.

<!-- Overview -->
I took the CKA exam on March 15, 2024, and passed it successfully. The exam was challenging, but I was able to pass it on my first attempt. I prepared for the exam by studying the official Kubernetes documentation, taking online courses, and practicing with Kubernetes clusters.

To aid my preparation, I enrolled in the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) course on Udemy, which helped me understand the core concepts of Kubernetes. I also utilized the [KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/udemy-labs-certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) platform to practice with Kubernetes clusters and complete hands-on labs. Below is my course completion certificate from KodeKloud:
