## 1. About the Certification

GitHub Foundations certification validates core skills in GitHub's basic structure and usage, from fundamental Git operations to enterprise collaboration features like CodeSpaces. This certification covers essential GitHub knowledge that every developer should possess in 2024, including:

- Basic Git and GitHub usage
- Advanced GitHub features: Issues, Pull Requests, Projects, Team Management
- Latest GitHub products: CodeSpaces, Copilot
- Enterprise features and administration

The exam consists of 75 multiple-choice questions to be completed within 120 minutes. 60 questions are scored while 15 are unscored experimental items. The certification is valid for 3 years upon passing.

My GitHub Foundations certification 2024. Issued on November 19, 2024. Expires on November 18, 2027. You can verify my certification [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/876fa6b3-0b27-4ddf-bbb3-a9d853918566).

I prepared for the certification using two main resources:

1. [Microsoft Learn - GitHub Foundations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations) (Free)
   - Comprehensive hands-on labs
   - Always up-to-date with latest GitHub features
   - Practical exercises through GitHub Skills platform

2. [LinkedIn Learning - Prepare for the GitHub Foundations Certification](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/prepare-for-the-github-foundations-certification) (Paid)
   - Video-based learning
   - Good for review and consolidation
   - Covers enterprise features thoroughly

Additionally, there's an excellent free comprehensive video guide from freeCodeCamp that covers both exam content and practical tips:

This video provides a thorough overview of the exam format and includes detailed explanations of key concepts. It's particularly helpful for understanding what to expect during the exam.

The exam tests both basic and advanced GitHub knowledge. While most questions were straightforward for experienced GitHub users, some enterprise-related questions were challenging. The exam interface provided features like:

- Question flagging for review
- Multiple-choice and multiple-select questions
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation

I found the enterprise and team management sections particularly challenging, as these features are difficult to practice without enterprise access. However, the hands-on experience from Microsoft Learn's labs proved invaluable for the practical aspects of the certification.

## 3. Summary

The GitHub Foundations certification is an excellent starting point for developers looking to validate their GitHub skills. While it may seem basic for experienced users, the certification covers important aspects of modern GitHub features that many developers might have overlooked, such as GitHub Copilot, CodeSpaces, and enterprise collaboration tools.

For those preparing for this certification, I recommend:
- Taking advantage of the free Microsoft Learn resources
- Practicing with GitHub Skills hands-on labs
- Focusing on enterprise features and team management concepts
- Watching for certification discount opportunities (sometimes available at 50-100% off)

While I don't plan to pursue other GitHub certifications immediately, I'm keeping an eye on upcoming GitHub AI certifications, particularly around GitHub Copilot and GitHub Models. For now, I'll focus on applying these validated skills in real-world projects and helping others in their GitHub journey.

I hope this post helps those considering the GitHub Foundations certification. Remember, effective version control and collaboration skills are fundamental to modern software development - whether you pursue this certification or not, mastering these skills is essential for any developer's career growth.
